    A game consists of
        * a start - the setup of the game, initialising players, dealing the initial cards
        * a middle - where players take turns to play their cards and the others have to respond
        * an end - where one player declares victory based on the criteria

    THIS IS THE START - Initialise the game

# TODO Mia Homework: Create the start of the game whereby we initialise the players

# Create an array to store the Players
# Create a loop for the number of players (numOfPlayers)
# For each iteration ask their name and assign an order of play
# Hint: simon = Player("Simon", 1)

# Next need to create a deck, with the shuffled cards
# Hint: look at shuffled deck in testCards.py

# Need a discard pile which will initially be empty
# Hint: similar to the shuffled deck but an empty list

# Finally need to deal 5 cards to EACH player - that might require a loop :-)
# Hint look at testPlayer.py

    THIS WILL BE THE MIDDLE - Where players take it in turns

    THIS WILL BE THE END - Where someone declares victory!
